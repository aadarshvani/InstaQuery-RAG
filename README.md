## Intelligent RAG-Based FAQ Assistant for Multi-Company Knowledge Integration

InstaQuery is an advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to provide instant, accurate responses to user queries across multiple company knowledge bases. This solution seamlessly integrates FAQ data from leading platforms like Meesho, Swiggy, Zomato, and other major companies to deliver a unified query resolution experience.

## Project Overview

InstaQuery transforms how users interact with company knowledge bases by leveraging state-of-the-art language models enhanced with retrieval capabilities. The system intelligently searches, retrieves, and synthesizes information from diverse sources to provide contextually relevant answers in real-time.
